# Parallax-hover-effect-JS
A demonstration of how I made a parallax mouse hover effect no libraries used.
Some of the things I learned making this demonstration is how to -
- Munapilate js DOM elements
- Set sensitivity for the effect
- How to use the mouse JS event
- how to use template literals to translates the coordinates for the layers
- how to use template literals to apply sensitivity for both layers
- how to align layers
